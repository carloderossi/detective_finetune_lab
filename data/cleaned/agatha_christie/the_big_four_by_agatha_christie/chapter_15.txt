15. THE TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE


It was after the tragic death of Miss Flossie Monro that I began to
be aware of a change in Poirot. Up to now, his invincible confidence
in himself had stood the test. But it seemed as though, at last, the
long strain was beginning to tell. His manner was grave and brooding,
and his nerves were on edge. In these days he was as jumpy as a cat.
He avoided all discussion of the Big Four as far as possible, and
seemed to throw himself into his ordinary work with almost his old
ardour. Nevertheless, I knew that he was secretly active in the big
matter. Extraordinary-looking Slavs were constantly calling to see
him, and though he vouchsafed no explanation as to these mysterious
activities, I realised that he was building some new defence or
weapon of opposition with the help of these somewhat repulsive-looking
foreigners. Once, purely by chance, I happened to see the entries in
his pass-book--he had asked me to verify some small item--and I noticed
the paying out of a huge sum--a huge sum even for Poirot who was
coining money nowadays--to some Russian with apparently every letter of
the alphabet in his name.

But he gave no clue as to the line on which he proposed to operate.
Only over and over again he gave utterance to one phrase. "It is the
greatest mistake to underestimate your adversary. Remember that, _mon
ami_." And I realised that that was the pitfall he was striving at
all costs to avoid.

So matters went on until the end of March, and then one morning Poirot
made a remark which startled me considerably.

"This morning, my friend, I should recommend the best suit. We go to
call upon the Home Secretary."

"Indeed? That is very exciting. He has called you in to take up a case?"

"Not exactly. The interview is of my seeking. You may remember my
saying that I once did him some small service? He is inclined to be
foolishly enthusiastic over my capabilities in consequence, and I
am about to trade on this attitude of his. As you know, the French
Premier, M. Desjardeaux is over in London, and at my request the Home
Secretary had arranged for him to be present at our little conference
this morning."

The Right Honourable Sydney Crowther, His Majesty's Secretary of State
for Home Affairs, was a well-known and popular figure. A man of some
fifty years of age, with a quizzical expression and shrewd gray eyes,
he received us with that delightful bonhomie of manner which was well
known to be one of his principal assets.

Standing with his back to the fireplace was a tall thin man with a
pointed black beard and a sensitive face.

"M. Desjardeaux," said Crowther. "Allow me to introduce to you M.
Hercule Poirot of whom you may, perhaps, already have heard."

The Frenchman bowed and shook hands.

"I have indeed heard of M. Hercule Poirot," he said pleasantly. "Who
has not?"

"You are too amiable, monsieur," said Poirot, bowing, but his face
flushed with pleasure.

"Any word for an old friend?" asked a quiet voice, and a man came
forward from a corner by a tall bookcase.

It was our old acquaintance, Mr. Ingles.

Poirot shook him warmly by the hand.

"And now, M. Poirot," said Crowther. "We are at your service. I
understood you to say that you had a communication of the utmost
importance to make to us."

"That is so, monsieur. There is in the world to-day a vast
organisation--an organisation of crime. It is controlled by four
individuals, who are known and spoken of as the Big Four. Number One is
a Chinaman, Li Chang Yen; Number Two is the American multi-millionaire,
Abe Ryland; Number Three is a Frenchwoman; Number Four I have every
reason to believe is an obscure English actor called Claud Darrell.
These four are banded together to destroy the existing social order,
and to replace it with an anarchy in which they would reign as
dictators."

"Incredible," muttered the Frenchman. "Ryland, mixed up with a thing of
that kind? Surely the idea is too fantastic."

"Listen, monsieur, whilst I recount to you some of the doings of this
Big Four."

It was an enthralling narrative which Poirot unfolded. Familiar as I
was with all the details, they thrilled me anew as I heard the bald
recital of our adventures and escapes.

M. Desjardeaux looked mutely at Mr. Crowther as Poirot finished. The
other answered the look.

"Yes, M. Desjardeaux, I think we must admit the existence of a 'Big
Four.' Scotland Yard was inclined to jeer at first, but they have been
forced to admit that M. Poirot was right in many of his claims. The
only question is the extent of its aims. I cannot but feel that M.
Poirot--er--exaggerates a little."

For answer Poirot set forth ten salient points. I have been asked not
to give them to the public even now, and so I refrain from doing so,
but they included the extraordinary disasters to submarines which
occurred in a certain month, and also a series of aeroplane accidents
and forced landings. According to Poirot, these were all the work of
the Big Four, and bore witness to the fact that they were in possession
of various scientific secrets unknown to the world at large.

This brought us straight to the question which I had been waiting for
the French Premier to ask.

"You say that the third member of this organisation is a Frenchwoman.
Have you any idea of her name?"

"It is a well-known name, monsieur. An honoured name. Number Three is
no less than the famous Madame Olivier."

At the mention of the world-famous scientist, successor to the Curies,
M. Desjardeaux positively bounded from his chair, his face purple with
emotion.

"Madame Olivier! Impossible! Absurd! It is an insult what you say
there!"

Poirot shook his head gently, but made no answer.

Desjardeaux looked at him in stupefaction for some moments. Then his
face cleared, and he glanced at the Home Secretary and tapped his
forehead significantly.

"M. Poirot is a great man," he observed. "But even the great
man--sometimes he has his little mania, does he not? And seeks in high
places for fancied conspiracies. It is well known. You agree with me,
do you not, Mr. Crowther?"

The Home Secretary did not answer for some minutes. Then he spoke
slowly and heavily.

"Upon my soul, I don't know," he said at last. "I have always had and
still have the utmost belief in M. Poirot, but--well, this takes a bit
of believing."

"This Li Chang Yen, too," continued M. Desjardeaux. "Who has ever heard
of him?"

"I have," said the unexpected voice of Mr. Ingles.

The Frenchman stared at him, and he stared placidly back again, looking
more like a Chinese idol than ever. "Mr. Ingles," explained the Home
Secretary, "is the greatest authority we have on the interior of China."

"And you have heard of this Li Chang Yen?"

"Until M. Poirot here came to me, I imagined that I was the only man
in England who had. Make no mistake, M. Desjardeaux, there is only one
man in China who counts to-day--Li Chang Yen. He has, perhaps, I only
say perhaps, the finest brain in the world at the present time."

M. Desjardeaux sat as though stunned. Presently, however, he rallied.

"There may be something in what you say, M. Poirot," he said coldly.
"But as regards Madame Olivier, you are most certainly mistaken. She is
a true daughter of France, and devoted solely to the cause of science."

Poirot shrugged his shoulders and did not answer.

There was a minute or two's pause, and then my little friend rose to
his feet, with an air of dignity that sat rather oddly upon his quaint
personality.

"That is all I have to say, messieurs--to warn you. I thought it
likely that I should not be believed. But at least you will be on your
guard. My words will sink in, and each fresh event that comes along
will confirm your wavering faith. It was necessary for me to speak
now--later I might not have been able to do so."

"You mean--?" asked Crowther, impressed in spite of himself by the
gravity of Poirot's tone.

"I mean, monsieur, that since I have penetrated the identity of Number
Four, my life is not worth an hour's purchase. He will seek to destroy
me at all costs--and not for nothing is he named 'The Destroyer.'
Messieurs, I salute you. To you, M. Crowther, I deliver this key, and
this sealed envelope. I have got together all my notes on the case,
and my ideas as to how best to meet the menace that any day may break
upon the world, and have placed them in a certain safe deposit. In the
event of my death, M. Crowther, I authorise you to take charge of those
papers and make what use you can of them. And now, messieurs, I wish
you good day."

Desjardeaux merely bowed coldly, but Crowther sprang up and held out
his hand.

"You have converted me, M. Poirot. Fantastic as the whole thing seems,
I believe utterly in the truth of what you have told us."

Ingles left at the same time as we did.

"I am not disappointed with the interview," said Poirot, as we walked
along. "I did not expect to convince Desjardeaux, but I have at least
ensured that, if I die, my knowledge does not die with me. And I have
made one or two converts. _Pas si mal!_"

"I'm with you, as you know," said Ingles. "By the way, I'm going out to
China as soon as I can get off."

"Is that wise?"

"No," said Ingles dryly. "But it's necessary. One must do what one can."

"Ah, you are a brave man!" cried Poirot with emotion. "If we were not
in the street, I would embrace you."

I fancied that Ingles looked rather relieved.

"I don't suppose that I shall be in any more danger in China than you
are in London," he growled.

"That is possibly true enough," admitted Poirot. "I hope that they will
not succeed in massacring Hastings also, that is all. That would annoy
me greatly."

I interrupted this cheerful conversation to remark that I had no
intention of letting myself be massacred, and shortly afterwards Ingles
parted from us.

For some time we went along in silence, which Poirot at length broke by
uttering a totally unexpected remark.

"I think--I really think--that I shall have to bring my brother into
this."

"Your brother," I cried, astonished. "I never knew you had a brother?"

"You surprise me, Hastings. Do you not know that all celebrated
detectives have brothers who would be even more celebrated then they
are were it not for constitutional indolence?"

Poirot employs a peculiar manner sometimes which makes it wellnigh
impossible to know whether he is jesting or in earnest. That manner was
very evident at the moment.

"What is your brother's name?" I asked, trying to adjust myself to this
new idea.

"Achille Poirot," replied Poirot gravely. "He lives near Spa in
Belgium."

"What does he do?" I asked with some curiosity, putting aside a
half-formed wonder as to the character and disposition of the late
Madame Poirot, and her classical taste in Christian names.

"He does nothing. He is, as I tell, of a singularly indolent
disposition. But his abilities are hardly less than my own--which is
saying a great deal."

"Is he like you to look at?"

"Not unlike. But not nearly so handsome. And he wears no moustaches."

"Is he older than you, or younger?"

"He happens to have been born on the same day."

"A twin," I cried.

"Exactly, Hastings. You jump to the right conclusion with unfailing
accuracy. But here we are at home again. Let us at once get to work on
that little affair of the Duchess's necklace."

But the Duchess's necklace was doomed to wait awhile. A case of quite
another description was waiting for us.

Our landlady, Mrs. Pearson, at once informed us that a hospital nurse
had called and was waiting to see Poirot.

We found her sitting in the big arm-chair facing the window, a
pleasant-faced woman of middle age, in a dark blue uniform. She was a
little reluctant to come to the point, but Poirot soon put her at her
ease, and she embarked upon her story.

"You see, M. Poirot, I've never come across anything of the kind
before. I was sent for, from the Lark Sisterhood, to go down to a case
in Hertfordshire. An old gentleman, it is, Mr. Templeton. Quite a
pleasant house, and quite pleasant people. The wife, Mrs. Templeton, is
much younger than her husband, and he has a son by his first marriage
who lives there. I don't know that the young man and the step-mother
always get on together. He's not quite what you'd call normal--not
'wanting' exactly, but decidedly dull in the intellect. Well, this
illness of Mr. Templeton's seemed to me from the first to be very
mysterious. At times there seemed really nothing the matter with him,
and then he suddenly has one of these gastric attacks with pain and
vomiting. But the doctor seemed quite satisfied, and it wasn't for me
to say anything. But I couldn't help thinking about it. And then--"

She paused, and became rather red.

"Something happened which aroused your suspicions?" suggested Poirot.

"Yes."

But she still seemed to find it difficult to go on.

"I found the servants were passing remarks too."

"About Mr. Templeton's illness?"

"Oh, no! About--about this other thing--"

"Mrs. Templeton?"

"Yes."

"Mrs. Templeton and the doctor, perhaps?"

Poirot had an uncanny flair in these things. The nurse threw him a
grateful glance and went on.

"They _were_ passing remarks. And then one day I happened to see
them together myself--in the garden--"

It was left at that. Our client was in such an agony of outraged
propriety that no one could feel it necessary to ask exactly what she
had seen in the garden. She had evidently seen quite enough to make up
her own mind on the situation.

"The attacks got worse and worse. Dr. Treves said it was all perfectly
natural and to be expected, and that Mr. Templeton could not possibly
live long, but I've never seen anything like it before myself--not in
all my long experience of nursing. It seemed to me much more like some
form of--"

She paused, hesitating.

"Arsenical poisoning?" said Poirot helpfully.

She nodded.

"And then, too, he, the patient, I mean, said something queer. 'They'll
do for me, the four of them. They'll do for me yet.'"

"Eh?" said Poirot quickly.

"Those were his very words, M. Poirot. He was in great pain at the
time, of course, and hardly knew what he was saying."

"'They'll do for me, the four of them,'" repeated Poirot thoughtfully.
"What did he mean by 'the four of them,' do you think?"

"That I can't say, M. Poirot. I thought perhaps he meant his wife
and son, and the doctor, and perhaps Miss Clark, Mrs. Templeton's
companion. That would make four, wouldn't it? He might think they were
all in league against him."

"Quite so, quite so," said Poirot, in a preoccupied voice. "What about
food? Could you take no precautions about that?"

"I'm always doing what I can. But, of course, sometimes Mrs. Templeton
insists on bringing him his food herself, and then there are the times
when I am off duty."

"Exactly. And you are not sure enough of your ground to go to the
police?"

The nurse's face showed her horror at the mere idea.

"What I have done, M. Poirot, is this. Mr. Templeton had a very bad
attack after partaking of a bowl of soup. I took a little from the
bottom of the bowl afterwards, and have brought it up with me. I have
been spared for the day to visit a sick mother, as Mr. Templeton was
well enough to be left."

She drew out a little bottle of dark fluid and handed it to Poirot.

"Excellent, mademoiselle. We will have this analysed immediately. If
you will return here in, say, an hour's time I think that we shall be
able to dispose of your suspicions one way or another."

First extracting from our visitor her name and qualifications, he
ushered her out. Then he wrote a note and sent it off together with
the bottle of soup. Whilst we waited to hear the result, Poirot amused
himself by verifying the nurse's credentials, somewhat to my surprise.

"No, no, my friend," he declared. "I do well to be careful. Do not
forget the Big Four are on our track."

However, he soon elicited the information that a nurse of the name of
Mabel Palmer was a member of the Lark Institute and had been sent to
the case in question.

"So far, so good," he said, with a twinkle. "And now here comes Nurse
Palmer back again, and here also is our analyst's report."

Both the nurse and I waited anxiously whilst Poirot read the analyst's
report.

"Is there arsenic in it?" she asked breathlessly.

Poirot shook his head, refolding the paper.

"No."

We were both immeasurably surprised.

"There is no arsenic in it," continued Poirot. "But there is antimony.
And that being the case, we will start immediately for Hertfordshire.
Pray Heaven that we are not too late."

It was decided that the simplest plan was for Poirot to represent
himself truly as a detective, but that the ostensible reason of his
visit should be to question Mrs. Templeton about a servant formerly in
her employment whose name he obtained from Nurse Palmer, and who he
could represent as being concerned in a jewel robbery.

It was late when we arrived at Elmstead, as the house was called. We
had allowed Nurse Palmer to precede us by about twenty minutes, so that
there should be no question of our all arriving together.

Mrs. Templeton, a tall dark woman, with sinuous movements and uneasy
eyes, received us. I noticed that as Poirot announced his profession,
she drew in her breath with a sudden hiss, as though badly startled,
but she answered his question about the maid-servant readily enough.
And then, to test her, Poirot embarked upon a long history of a
poisoning case in which a guilty wife had figured. His eyes never left
her face as he talked, and try as she would, she could hardly conceal
her rising agitation. Suddenly, with an incoherent word of excuse, she
hurried from the room.

We were not long left alone. A squarely-built man with a small red
moustache and pince-nez came in.

"Dr. Treves," he introduced himself. "Mrs. Templeton asked me to make
her excuses to you. She's in a very bad state, you know. Nervous
strain. Worry over her husband and all that. I've prescribed bed and
bromide. But she hopes you'll stay and take pot luck, and I'm to do
host. We've heard of you down here, M. Poirot, and we mean to make the
most of you. Ah, here's Micky!"

A shambling young man entered the room. He had a very round face, and
foolish-looking eyebrows raised as though in perpetual surprise. He
grinned awkwardly as he shook hands. This was clearly the "wanting"
son.

Presently we all went in to dinner. Dr. Treves left the room--to open
some wine, I think---and suddenly the boy's physiognomy underwent a
startling change. He leant forward, staring at Poirot.

"You've come about father," he said, nodding his head. "_I_ know.
I know lots of things--but nobody thinks I do. Mother will be glad when
father's dead and she can marry Dr. Treves. She isn't my own mother,
you know. I don't like her. She wants father to die."

It was all rather horrible. Luckily, before Poirot had time to reply,
the doctor came back, and we had to carry on a forced conversation.

And then suddenly Poirot lay back in his chair with a hollow groan. His
face was contorted with pain.

"My dear sir, what's the matter?" cried the doctor.

"A sudden spasm. I am used to them. No, no, I require no assistance
from you, doctor. If I might lie down upstairs."

His request was instantly acceded to, and I accompanied him upstairs,
where he collapsed on the bed, groaning heavily.

For the first minute or two I had been taken in, but I had quickly
realised that Poirot was--as he would have put it--playing the comedy,
and that his object was to be left alone upstairs near the patient's
room.

Hence I was quite prepared when, the instant we were alone, he sprang
up.

"Quick, Hastings, the window. There is ivy outside. We can climb down
before they begin to suspect."

"Climb down?"

"Yes, we must get out of this house at once. You saw him at dinner?"

"The doctor?"

"No, young Templeton. His trick with his bread. Do you remember what
Flossie Monro told us before she died? That Claud Darrell had a
habit of dabbing his bread on the table to pick up crumbs. Hastings,
this is a vast plot, and that vacant-looking young man is our arch
enemy--Number Four! Hurry."

I did not wait to argue. Incredible as the whole thing seemed, it was
wiser not to delay. We scrambled down the ivy as quietly as we could
and made a bee-line for the small town and the railway station. We were
just able to catch the last train, the 8.34 which would land us in town
about eleven o'clock.

"A plot," said Poirot thoughtfully. "How many of them were in it, I
wonder? I suspect that the whole Templeton family are just so many
agents of the Big Four. Did they simply want to decoy us down there? Or
was it more subtle than that. Did they intend to play the comedy down
there and keep me interested until they had had time to do--what? I
wonder now."

He remained very thoughtful.

Arrived at our lodgings, he restrained me at the door of the
sitting-room.

"Attention, Hastings. I have my suspicions. Let me enter first."

He did so, and, to my slight amusement, took the precaution to press
on the electric switch with an old galosh. Then he went round the room
like a strange cat, cautiously, delicately, on the alert for danger. I
watched him for some time, remaining obediently where I had been put by
the wall.

"It's all right, Poirot," I said impatiently.

"It seems so, _mon ami_, it seems so. But let us make sure."

"Rot," I said. "I shall light the fire, anyway, and have a pipe. I've
caught you out for once. You had the matches last and you didn't put
them back in the holder as usual--the very thing you're always cursing
me for doing."

I stretched out my hand. I heard Poirot's warning cry--saw him leaping
towards me--my hand touched the match-box.

Then--a flash of blue flame--an ear-rending crash--and darkness--

I came to myself to find the familiar face of our old friend Dr.
Ridgeway bending over me. An expression of relief passed over his
features.

"Keep still," he said soothingly. "You're all right. There's been an
accident, you know."

"Poirot?" I murmured.

"You're in my digs. Everything's quite all right."

A cold fear clutched at my heart. His evasion woke a horrible fear.

"Poirot?" I reiterated. "What of Poirot."

He saw that I had to know and that further evasions were useless.

"By a miracle you escaped--Poirot--did not!"

A cry burst from my lips.

"Not dead? Not dead?"

Ridgeway bowed his head, his features working with emotion.

With desperate energy I pulled myself to a sitting position.

"Poirot may be dead," I said weakly. "But his spirit lives on. I will
carry on his work! Death to the Big Four!"

Then I fell back, fainting.
